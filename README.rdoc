This repo demonstrates to issues with Roar/Representable.

1. ActiveSupport is overriding the to_json method somehow when using modules, preventing collections from being output according to their representer

2. Objects are unable to be extended with multiple modules.

run `rake` to run the tests(`test/models/representers_test.rb`) demonstrating the failure.
